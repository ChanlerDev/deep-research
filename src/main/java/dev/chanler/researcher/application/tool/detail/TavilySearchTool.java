            Fetch results from Tavily search API with content summarization.
            
            Use this tool to search the web for information relevant to your research topic.
            Provide a specific, well-formed search query to get the best results.
            
            Best practices for search queries:
            - Be specific and use relevant keywords
            - Include important context or qualifiers (e.g., "2024", "latest", "comparison")
            - For factual questions, phrase as a question
            - For research topics, use descriptive phrases
            
            Examples:
            - "climate change impact on Arctic ice 2024"
            - "comparison of electric vehicle batteries lithium vs solid state"
            - "What are the latest breakthroughs in quantum computing?"
